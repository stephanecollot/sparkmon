How to report a bug
-------------------

Report bugs on the `Issue Tracker`_.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.6+ and the following tools:

- Poetry_
- Nox_
- nox-poetry_

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python
   $ poetry run sparkmon

If you want to install it in your environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry build --format sdist
   $ tar -xvf dist/*-`poetry version -s`.tar.gz -O '*/setup.py' > setup.py
   $ pip install -e .

.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/
.. _Nox: https://nox.thea.codes/
.. _nox-poetry: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/


How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

.. _pytest: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/


How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull request`_ to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 90% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before commiting your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install

Recommended way to run linting and code formatting:
.. code:: console

   $ # with python 3.7
   $ git add -u
   $ nox --session=pre-commit
   $ git add -u
   $ git commit -m "" --no-verify


It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

How release a new version
-------------------------

Make a new branch only to make the release and run `poetry version`, as follow:

.. code:: console

   $ git checkout master
   $ git pull
   $ # Where <version> = X.X.X
   $ git checkout -b release_<version>
   $ poetry version <version>
   $ git add pyproject.toml
   $ git commit -m "<project> <version>"
   $ git push

Then make a pull request, and merge it to master.
It will automatically: make a release note in Github, make a tag and release to PyPI
