Description
-----------

``sparkmon`` is a Python package to monitor Spark applications. You can see it as an advanced Spark UI, that keep track all of `Spark REST API <SparkREST_>`_ metrics over time. It is specifically useful to do memory profiling.


Features
--------

Monitoring plot example:

.. image:: docs/_static/monitoring-plot-example.png

Disclaimer: Be aware that if you run Spark in local mode some of the subplots will be empty, sparkmon is designed to analyse Spark applications running in a cluster.

* Log the executors metrics
* Plot monitoring, display in a notebook, or export to a file
* Can monitor remote Spark application
* Can run directly in your PySpark application, or run in a notebook, or via the command-line interface
* Log to mlflow


Requirements
------------

* Python
* Spark
* mlflow (optional)


Installation
------------

You can install *sparkmon* via pip_ from PyPI_:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install sparkmon
   $ pip install sparkmon[mlflow]


Usage
-----

Simple use-case:

.. code-block:: python

   import sparkmon

   # Create and start the monitoring process via a Spark session
   mon = sparkmon.SparkMon(spark, period=5, callbacks=[
       sparkmon.callbacks.plot_to_image,
       sparkmon.callbacks.log_to_mlflow,
   ])
   mon.start()

   # Stop monitoring
   mon.stop()

More advanced use-case:

.. code-block:: python

   import sparkmon

   # Create an app connection
   # via a Spark session
   application = sparkmon.create_application_from_spark(spark)
   # or via a remote Spark web UI link
   application = sparkmon.create_application_from_link(index=0, web_url='http://localhost:4040')

   # Create and start the monitoring process
   mon = sparkmon.SparkMon(application, period=5, callbacks=[
       sparkmon.callbacks.plot_to_image,
       sparkmon.callbacks.log_to_mlflow,
   ])
   mon.start()

   # Stop monitoring
   mon.stop()

You can also use it from a notebook: `Notebook Example <Example_>`_

There is also a command-line interface, see  `Command-line Reference <Usage_>`_ for details.


How does it work?
-----------------

``SparkMon`` is running in the background a Python thread that is querying Spark web UI API and logging all the executors information over time.

The ``callbacks`` list parameters allows you to define what do after each update, like exporting executors historical info to a csv, or plotting to a file, or to your notebook.
